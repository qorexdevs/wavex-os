/** Paperclip handoff bridge (Slice 1 — Phase D opt-in handoff).
 *
 *  After bridgeAgents writes the swarm topology to the wavex DB, optionally
 *  hand off the same agents to a running Paperclip instance so they get a
 *  real runtime (heartbeats, claude CLI execution, KPI snapshots, fleet
 *  observation). Opt-in via PAPERCLIP_HANDOFF_URL env var; when unset, this
 *  is a no-op and bridgeAgents-only is the contract.
 *
 *  Idempotent: a per-wavex-company mapping is persisted to
 *  ~/.wavex-os/instances/<wavexCompanyId>/paperclip-handoff.json so re-runs
 *  reuse the same Paperclip companyId + agentIds. Hires that already exist
 *  on the Paperclip side are skipped (name+role match).
 *
 *  v1 scope:
 *    - Creates a Paperclip company on first activate of a wavex company
 *    - Hires the C-Suite + CEO Orchestrator (ceo, cpo, cmo, cro, cfo, cdo, coo)
 *    - Skips L·IV+ specialists for now (mapping to Paperclip's constrained
 *      role enum is lossy for sub-roles; that's a v2 mapping problem)
 *    - Each hire's instructionsBundle.files["AGENTS.md"] is assembled from the
 *      role's per-template SKILL.md + concatenated SKILL_*.md files at
 *      packages/onboarding-ui/public/agent-templates/<role>/
 *    - Auto-approves the hire if the Paperclip server returns an approval
 *      record (Paperclip 0.3.x board flow on local_trusted)

/** Per-tenant MCP scoping.
 *
 *  Root cause of pre-fix bug: Paperclip's claude-local adapter spawned the
 *  global `claude` CLI which transitively inherited the operator's installed
 *  MCP plugins (Supabase, Amplitude, Meta Ads, etc.). Every tenant's agent
 *  saw the operator's entire toolbelt — a cross-tenant data leak AND an
 *  autocompact thrash multiplier (multi-KB JSON tool outputs filling the
 *  context within ~10 turns).
 *
 *  Fix: emit a per-tenant mcp.json under the paperclip company's home and
 *  point each agent's claude CLI at it via `--mcp-config <path>
 *  --strict-mcp-config`. The strict flag tells claude to ignore the global
 *  registry entirely. Tenants that connected nothing get an empty
 *  {"mcpServers":{}} — zero tools, deterministic — rather than inheriting
 *  the operator's globally-installed MCPs.
 *
 *  Schema mapping (connector id -> MCP server spec) is intentionally a
 *  small static allowlist. This file does NOT write secrets — connector
 *  credentials live in the operator's keychain / Composio brokerage and
 *  the MCP server entries here only specify the executable + args; the
 *  MCP server itself reads credentials from env or its own config. */

 *  already-mapped slots, so a fleet hired before the manifest-driven CEO
 *  bundle / overlay rewrite still reads the old WaveX-Experiences-hardcoded
 *  AGENTS.md on disk. This refreshes those files in place against the

 *  agents already exist — we just rewrite what they READ at next heartbeat.
