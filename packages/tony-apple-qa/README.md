**Tony Apple QA** is an AI-powered QA operating system for mobile-app teams. Answer five questions about your app and go-to-market, and the wizard spins up a full QA agent fleet on your laptop — smoke tests, regression coverage plans, release checklists, and a Mission Control dashboard — all running locally on your Claude Max subscription, no API keys required.

npm install -g tony-apple-qa
tony-apple-qa init
